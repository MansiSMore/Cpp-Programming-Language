//My First CPP Demo Code.
//This statement tells a compiler to add or include declarations of the standard stream I/O facilities as found in iostream .
#include <iostream>

//The std specifies that the name cout is to be found in the standard-library namespace.
using namespace std;

//Entry point function.
int main()
{
	cout << "Hello World..!" << endl;			//cout is same as printf function from c.
	return 0;
}
